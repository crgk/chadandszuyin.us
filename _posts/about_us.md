We met at Iowa State University when we were both serving as committee members for the student-run philanthropy, Dance Marathon. Our first real interaction involved us running around Iowa State's Central Campus covered from head to toe in teal paint as part of a promotional stunt for Dance Marathon. Luckily, our first shared memories together were all captured by our Dance Marathon PR team, so - no worries - you can all [relive those special moments on YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NGdumodZ7cE) (Chad's the one in the luchador mask).

From there, we both went on to serve on Dance Marathon's executive team for two years, including leading a committee together in 2013. We found that we made great partners, and decided to start dating.

After college, we moved to Chicago and welcomed our furry little bud, Udon, into our lives. We like Chicago so much that we decided to buy our first home together in Wicker Park.

Over the years, we've enjoyed many trips and adventures together, and we look forward to many more to come!
